# 📝 ClassNotes CLI

Take and manage class notes straight from your terminal — fast, organized, and distraction-free.

This project includes two CLI tools:

- `classnote`: Take a new note using your terminal editor
- `classnotes`: List, open, and search notes by subject

> 💡 Notes are saved under `~/.class_notes/<subject>/<timestamp>.txt`

---

- 📌 One-line note creation from anywhere in terminal  
- 📁 Automatically organized by subject and timestamp

## 📥 Installation

### 🔨 Manual Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/classnotes-cli.git
cd classnotes-cli

2. Make the scripts executable:

chmod +x classnote classnotes

3.Create a ~/bin folder if it doesn't exist and symlink the scripts:
mkdir -p ~/bin

ln -s "$PWD/classnote" ~/bin/classnote
ln -s "$PWD/classnotes" ~/bin/classnotes

4.Add ~/bin to your PATH (if it’s not already):

- For Zsh (macOS default):

echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

- For Bash:
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

Optional One-Liner Setup (if setup.sh is added later)
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR-USERNAME/classnotes-cli/main/setup.sh | bash
